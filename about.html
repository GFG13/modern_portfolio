          <p>
            With a passion for analytical problem-solving, I've managed a
            complex research project, proposed novel rock testing techniques,
            and communicated my work on an international stage. As a graduate
            student leader, I've been an advocate for life-long learning and
            encourage ongoing personal and professional development.

          <h5>Researcher (PhD. Candidate)</h5>
          <p>
            Throughout my academic career, I've investigated problems related to
            rock strength and mechanical stability of excavations, while also
            having exposure to state-of-the-art methods for characterising
            stress uncertainty using statistical tools. As part of my PhD, I
            carried out experimental testing on thawing ice-filled rock
            fractures, developed a multi-physics numerical simulation to model
            the experiment, and analysed the effect of thawing permafrost by
            measuring underground temperatures in a full-scale mine drift in
            Siberia, Russia.

            I prepared and facilitated engaging lectures and tutorials, and

            I've also been involved in implementing a flipped-classroom teaching
            strategy, in an effort to increase student engagement. I continually
            aim to provide students with experiential learning opportunities,
            such as a site visit to witness explosions at a local quarry, with
            whom I've been able to establish a long-standing relationship.

            My role as chair allowed me to exercise my leadership skills through

            students aimed at different aspects of leadership development.
            During my time with ILead:Grad, we managed to increased student
            attendance of events by 20% compared to the previous year, for a
            total of 150+ attendees at a single event, fulfilling our

          <h6>Graduate Student Seminar Series</h6>
          <p>
            While completing my master's degree, I noticed a severe lack of
            comradery, and communication amongst my peers in my department. In
            response, I pioneered a collaborative graduate student forum to
            share knowledge and collect feedback on research and presentation
            skills. I successfully consulted department administrators to gain
            support and recruited industry professionals for several keynote
            presentations.

            Shortly after finishing my competitive swimming career, I took on a
            supervisory volunteering role with Swimming Canada to eventually
            manage and train a large group of youth volunteers to effectively
            assist world-class swimmers at the 2015 PanAm Games. This involved
            directing and coordinating our youth volunteers during the swimming
            competition and the medal ceremonies.

            I've spent over 15 years as competitive swimmer with National-level
            success, with some time as varsity team captain (2011-2012) at the
            University of Waterloo. More recently, I've been putting my energy
            towards training for triathlons.
